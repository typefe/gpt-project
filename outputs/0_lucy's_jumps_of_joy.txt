Lucy's Jumps of Joy
Lucy was feeling so joyful and full of energy, she just had to express it somehow. So she started jumping up and down excitedly, her long blonde hair flying around her face as she jumped higher and higher. Even the birds in the trees began to join her in singing a joyous song. Everyone around smiled at Lucy's happiness and watched in awe as she jumped higher than anyone thought possible. 

When Lucy eventually stopped, she realized everyone was watching her in amazement. She smiled broadly and gave a little curtsy, then ran off laughing to explore new ways of expressing her joy. From that day on, Lucy always found ways to turn everyday moments into little jumps of pure joy.
