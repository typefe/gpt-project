Adventures in the Garden
Alice was always an adventurer, so she decided to explore the garden that her family had recently moved into. She tiptoed through the grass, excited to discover what she would find. Suddenly, Alice saw a patch of bright flowers in the corner of the garden. She carefully approached them and began to pick them one by one, admiring their beauty. As Alice gently plucked away, she noticed all the different shapes and colors of the petals and leaves surrounding her. She was in awe of how vibrant they looked together. After collecting a handful of flowers, Alice put them in her basket and made her way back home. She felt so proud of her adventure and couldn't wait to show off her beautiful collection to everyone!
