Jake's Hide-and-Seek Adventure
Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jake who loved playing hide-and-seek with his friends. Every weekend, he and his friends would have a huge game of hide-and-seek in the nearby park. 

One day, Jake decided to hide in a tree. He climbed up as high as he could and tried to stay very still so no one would be able to find him. Unfortunately, his plan didn't work out too well because one of his friends found him right away! 

Undeterred, Jake decided to try again the next week. This time he hid behind some bushes near the playground. It seemed like the perfect hiding spot but again he was found by one of his friends pretty quickly! 

Jake couldn't believe it! He was determined not to be found this time so he came up with an even better plan. He would build a tiny little fort out of sticks and hide inside it until everyone had finished looking for him. 

When it was time for everyone to come out of hiding, Jake was the last one to be found! His friends were so impressed with how well he had hidden that they all decided to play hide-and-seek again next weekend. 

Jake couldn't wait for their next game and soon enough, it arrived. This time around, Jake was sure that nobody would be able to find him - and he was right! After hours of searching, his friends eventually found him tucked away in his fort! 
It had been an exciting adventure and Jake couldn't wait for their next game of hide-and-seek!
