Joey's Sandcastle Adventure 
Once upon a time there was a little boy named Joey who loved nothing more than playing in the sand at the beach. One day, he decided to make an incredible sandcastle. He spent all morning gathering up buckets of sand and carefully shaping it into walls and towers. He even added some shells and stones to decorate the castle. 

Once his masterpiece was complete, Joey stepped back to admire his work. But then he realized he hadn't accounted for the tide! As the waves came in, his beautiful castle began to crumble away until it disappeared completely! 

Joey was disappointed, but not for long because soon he found a new way to have fun with the sand. He dug a tunnel underneath his sandcastle so that when the tide came in and washed away his structure, it also filled up his secret tunnel with water! Joey swam around inside until it was time to go home for lunch. 

When he returned in the afternoon, much of Joey's sandcastle had already been washed away by the sea leaving behind only a few of its towers standing tall and proud. But this didn't stop him from having more fun because now he had an amazing moat around what remained of his castle! 

Joey had an amazing time exploring both inside and outside of his special sandcastle until it was finally time to go home. He couldn't wait for another adventure at the beach soon!
