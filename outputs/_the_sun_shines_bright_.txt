 The Sun Shines Bright 
It was a beautiful day outside. The sun was shining brightly in the bright blue sky and the birds were chirping away. There wasn't a cloud in sight and the temperature was perfect. All of the animals were out enjoying the day, playing and running around in the grass and under the trees. 

The children all grabbed their bikes and skateboards and ran outside to join in on the fun. They went up and down hills, raced each other around on their bicycles, and had a great time playing together. Even when it was time to go home for lunch, they couldn't help but stay out a little bit longer to enjoy the beautiful day outside. 

As they said their goodbyes, they looked up into the sky one more time wishing that every day could be this beautiful. And with that thought in mind, they waved goodbye to each other until they could come back out again tomorrow for another wonderful day in the sunshine.
