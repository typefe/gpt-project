Ice Cream Adventure
Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Mary. She was feeling quite bored and wanted to find something fun to do. Suddenly, she had a brilliant idea - why not go on an ice cream adventure? She quickly grabbed her hat and coat and set off to the store to find her favorite ice cream cone. 

When she arrived, the store was filled with tantalizing flavors of ice cream. Mary couldn't decide which flavor she wanted, so she decided to try them all! After sampling many delicious ice creams, she finally made her selection - vanilla mint! 

Mary happily took her cone and went outside where the sun was shining brightly. She began eating the sweet treat as she walked around enjoying the sights and sounds of nature. While savoring each bite of her yummy ice cream cone, Mary felt happy and content as if nothing could ruin her day. 

When Mary finished eating her cone, she licked her lips in satisfaction and smiled knowing that this had been a truly delicious adventure!
