Harry and His Bike
Harry was so excited to finally be able to ride his bike around the neighborhood. He had been counting down the days until his parents said he was old enough to do so. As he pedaled along, he waved hello to all of the neighbors that he saw. Everyone waved back, smiling at how happy Harry was. 

He rode past trees with bright pink and purple flowers, feeling like he was in a fairy tale. The wind blew through his hair as he rode faster and faster, feeling free and alive. Whenever he got too far ahead of himself, he would slow down and take in all the wonderful sights around him. 

Soon enough, it was time for Harry to head home for dinner. He felt so lucky to be able to have such an amazing bike ride around his neighborhood every day before dinner. As he pedaled off into the sunset, Harry couldn't help but feel grateful for all of the people and places that surrounded him.
