Tom's Big Jump 
Once upon a time there was a boy named Tom who loved to play outside. One day, he decided to go on an adventure around his neighborhood. As he walked, he noticed large puddles of water everywhere and thought to himself, "What fun it would be to jump over them!" So with that thought in his mind, he took off running and jumping over each puddle. He felt so proud of himself as he went further and further. Suddenly, he came across the biggest puddle of all! He took a deep breath and jumped with all his might. He soared over the puddle with ease and even shocked himself at how far he had gone. He couldn't help but smile as he continued walking around the neighborhood. Tom had had so much fun jumping over the puddles that day!
