Sally's Block Tower
Sally was determined to build the tallest tower with her blocks. She carefully chose each one, making sure they all fit together perfectly. She started from the bottom and worked her way up, adding block after block until it was almost as tall as she was. 

She smiled proudly as she stepped back to admire her work - a tall tower of brightly colored blocks that even reached the ceiling! She'd done it! 

The tower wobbled when she tried to add one more block at the very top, so she quickly took it back off. That was enough for today - Sally had made a magnificent structure and couldn't wait to come back tomorrow to build it even higher!
