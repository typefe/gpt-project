Sally's Coloring Adventure
Sally was excited to start coloring her new picture. She opened up her box of crayons and grabbed the red one. She started drawing a beautiful sun in the corner of the page and filled it with bright red and yellow colors. Sally then moved on to finishing the sky, using a soft blue color to add depth. She added purple, pink, and orange clouds that floated across the sky.

Next, she colored in a large green tree with light green leaves. Sally used a dark brown crayon to finish off all the tree branches and then made its trunk with an orange crayon. To make her picture even more beautiful, she added some yellow flowers around the tree in various shapes and sizes.

Sally was so proud of her masterpiece when it was finished! She looked at it for a moment before putting away her box of crayons. It had been an exciting adventure bringing this picture to life with all her favorite colors!
