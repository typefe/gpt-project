 Giggles of Joy
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful baby called Lucy. She was the happiest baby in the world and she always had a smile on her face. One day, Lucy was playing with her favourite toy - a bright yellow duck. When Lucy pulled its string, the duck began to quack and she started giggling with delight. The sound of her laughter filled the room and soon everyone around her was laughing too. The little baby could not stop giggling as she played with her toy duck and it made everyone's heart melt with joy. Her parents were so proud that they could share this moment with their daughter and even though she was only a few months old, they knew that this special moment would stay in their hearts forever.
