Grandma's Colorful Scarf
Once upon a time, there was a kind and loving Grandma who loved to knit. Every day, she would spend hours sitting in her cozy chair, surrounded by colorful yarns and knitting needles. One day, Grandma had an idea - why not knit a scarf with all the colors of the rainbow? 

So she got to work right away! She chose all different colors of yarn and began knitting the scarf. She knitted with all of the bright colors and they looked so happy together. As she finished each row, it became more beautiful! 

When the scarf was done, it was truly amazing - it was full of different shades of reds, oranges, yellows, greens, blues and purples. It was a sight to behold! 
Grandma knew that this scarf would keep someone warm and happy every time they put it on. So she wrapped it up as a surprise gift for her granddaughter. 

When the granddaughter opened her present, she was so excited about the colorful scarf that her Grandma had made for her! She put on the scarf right away and ran outside to show all of her friends. Everyone loved it so much that they asked Grandma if she could make them one too! 

And from then on, whenever someone needed a warm hug or a smile on their face - they went to see Grandma for one of her colorful scarves!
