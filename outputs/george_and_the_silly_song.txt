George and the Silly Song
George was a happy, upbeat boy, always ready for an adventure. One day, he was walking through the park singing a song. He sang with enthusiasm and joy, even though the words were silly and made no sense at all.

The other people in the park were amused by his singing. They laughed and encouraged him to continue singing his silly song. As George sang louder and more boldly, everyone around him began to sing along, making up their own silly lyrics to accompany his tune. 

Before long, a real party had erupted in the park. Everyone cheered and danced as they sang their silly songs together. Even George's dog joined in, barking along with the tune! 

When it was time for George to go home, everyone waved goodbye as he walked away humming his silly song. Everywhere George went from that day on he brought joy with his funny tunes and laughter with his silly songs!
