"The Skipping Girl"
Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Annie who loved to skip. Every day when she walked down the street, she would skip and sing softly to herself. All the people in the neighborhood knew her as "the skipping girl". 

One summer day, Annie was out skipping and singing as usual. She stopped to pick some pretty flowers that were growing near her house. As she skipped along, she noticed a dog in a nearby yard that was barking at her. Annie wasn't scared though; she simply continued on her way, smiling and skipping all the while.

The dog's owner saw what was happening and decided to come out of his house to meet Annie. He asked her why she was skipping down the street and Annie replied that it made her feel happy! The man smiled at the little girl's enthusiasm and asked if he could join in too. 

So for the next few minutes, Annie and the man skipped down the street together. He was having so much fun that he asked if he could skip with her every day! Of course, Annie said yes! 

From then on out, every day after school, Annie and her new friend would meet up and skip down the street until it was time for dinner. It quickly became their favorite thing to do together! To this day they still skip around together, always with huge smiles on their faces!
