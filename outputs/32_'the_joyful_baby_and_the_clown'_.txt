'The Joyful Baby and the Clown' 
Once upon a time, there was a baby who was always filled with joy. One day, the baby went to the circus and saw a clown. When he saw the clown's funny antics, he laughed out loud! His laughter was so contagious that all of the other children in the audience started to laugh too. Everyone around him was so entertained by his laughter. The clown began to perform even funnier tricks and made funny faces which made the baby laugh even harder. Soon, everyone in the audience couldn't help but smile at this delightful scene. After the show ended, everyone thanked the clown for making them laugh so much and they especially thanked the baby for putting so much joy into their hearts with his laughter.
