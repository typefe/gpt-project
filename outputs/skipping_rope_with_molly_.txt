Skipping Rope with Molly 
Molly was so excited to be playing in her backyard. She brought out her favourite skipping rope and started jumping. Her mom watched from the porch as Molly skipped back and forth, counting each time she jumped over the rope. She could feel the sun on her face as she kept jumping, higher and faster each time. After a few minutes, Molly got tired but she didn't want to stop having fun. So, she decided to try a few tricks with the rope like hopping twice over it without touching the ground or spinning around while skipping at the same time. Molly was so proud of herself when she accomplished these tricks! She finally stopped skipping for a while to catch her breath. Then she started again, this time inviting all of her friends from across the street to join in on the fun!
