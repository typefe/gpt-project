The Happiest Day
Once upon a time, there was a small village with friendly people who were always kind to each other. One day, the entire village gathered around a huge bonfire in the square of the village. Everyone was laughing and having fun while they roasted marshmallows and chatted around the fire. 

The children raced around playing tag and hide-and-seek, and the adults enjoyed telling stories that made everyone laugh. At night, they all sang folk songs with their eyes twinkling in the light of the bonfire. It was truly a magical moment! 

By morning, everyone had made so many happy memories. The villagers felt like they were part of one big family, and were filled with joy for being able to spend time together in such a special way. They all agreed that it had been the happiest day ever!
