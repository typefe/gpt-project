Sam's Yummy Treat
Once upon a time there was a little boy named Sam. On a nice, sunny day, Sam decided to go out and treat himself to some ice cream. He happily skipped down the street to the ice cream shop and stepped inside. He immediately spotted his favorite flavor - chocolate chip. He quickly placed his order for a big, yummy ice cream cone and reached into his pocket for some money. 

The cashier handed him the cone and he carefully took it outside. Taking his first bite, the cold, sweet flavor filled his senses and he smiled from ear to ear with delight. He savored every bite of the cool treat as he licked it up until it was all gone! After finishing up his yummy snack, Sam happily waved goodbye to the shop and skipped home with a smile on his face.
