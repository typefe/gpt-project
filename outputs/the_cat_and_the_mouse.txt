The Cat and the Mouse
Once upon a time, there was a curious cat that lived in a big house. One day, when the cat was exploring, it heard a tiny noise coming from the corner of the room. To its surprise, it discovered a little mouse running around! The cat was excited and decided to chase after the mouse around the house. The mouse ran as fast as it could but couldn't outrun the cat. Finally, exhausted, it stopped moving and looked at the cat with big eyes. After a long moment of staring at each other, both went their separate ways: the cat back to its spot in front of the fireplace and the mouse scurrying away to safety.
