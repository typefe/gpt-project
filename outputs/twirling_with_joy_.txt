Twirling with Joy 
Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Grace. She was so excited for her birthday party that she couldn't contain her happiness. She put on her pretty white dress with frills and a pink bow on the back and looked in the mirror. She twirled around, admiring how the dress made her feel beautiful. The sun's rays shimmered off her dress as she kept spinning and spinning until she felt dizzy. 

Grace grabbed the hands of her mum and dad who were standing in awe of their daughter's beauty and joy. As they kept twirling together, Grace's friends started arriving for the party. They all giggled at how graceful and happy Grace looked in her beautiful dress. Soon, all of them began to twirl around in circles to celebrate Grace's special day! 

The whole room was filled with laughter and joy as everyone spun around happily in their pretty dresses like colourful petals of a flower. Even after they stopped spinning, Grace couldn't take off her eyes from the pretty dress she was wearing; it made her feel special like a princess.

At the end of the day, Grace's parents tucked her into bed with a big hug, thanking God for making such an amazing little girl who brightened up their lives with twirling energy and joy!
