The Bluest Sky 
Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lucy who loved to dream. Every day she would go outside and admire the beautiful sky, for it was always so blue. Lucy would take out her box of art supplies and set up her easel to paint the sky's stunning azure colour. 

One day, while she was painting, Lucy noticed something strange in the sky. There were little fluffy white clouds that seemed to appear out of nowhere and quickly drifted away. She had never seen clouds like these before! 

Lucy couldn't help but be filled with curiosity and excitement about these mysterious clouds. She wanted to know more about them and where they came from, or even if they had any special powers like in the stories she read in books. So she followed them as far as she could. 

After a while, Lucy realized that the little clouds had disappeared but the sky still remained an amazing shade of blue! She learned that the sky was always this way every day when she went outside to paint it- no matter what kind of weather it was or how many clouds there were in the sky. 

“The sky is so blue!” Lucy said with amazement as she looked up into the endless expanse of blue above her head, filled with awe and wonder at nature's beauty. She smiled contentedly before going back home, feeling grateful for all that nature has given us and humbled by its beauty.
