A Fun Story Time
Once upon a time, there was a family who loved spending time together. One day, Daddy decided to read a funny story to the children. They were so excited and couldn't wait to hear it. He began reading, and the kids were in tears from laughing so hard!  Daddy kept reading, adding funny voices for each of the characters. The kids were so enthralled that they refused to go to bed until he finished the story! In the end, everyone was happy and had enjoyed their special story time together.
