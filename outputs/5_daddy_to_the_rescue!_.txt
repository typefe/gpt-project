Daddy to the Rescue! 
Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Jenny who was very excited because her daddy was taking her for a bike ride! But when they got to the park, Jenny's excitement quickly faded away as she realized that her bike had a flat tire. She started to feel sad, but then she remembered that her daddy was the best fixer in town. She watched as he took the tire off and examined it closely. He then went off and found some glue and patched up the tire. Jenny couldn't believe it - it looked just like new! And that day, thanks to Daddy's super fixing skills, Jenny enjoyed an amazing bike ride in the park with her dad.
