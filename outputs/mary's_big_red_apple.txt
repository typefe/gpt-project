Mary's Big Red Apple
Once upon a time there lived a little girl, named Mary. One day she went on a walk in the woods near her house. While walking, she spotted a big red apple hanging from a tree. She was so excited that she ran to the tree and climbed it with ease. She plucked the big red apple and took it home with her. 

When Mary arrived home, her mom was very impressed by how big and juicy the apple looked. They both decided to have it for dessert that night. Mary cut the apple into small pieces and they all shared it together. It was very sweet and delicious! 

From then on, Mary always looked forward to going for a walk in the woods, hoping to find another big red apple just like that one again!
