Adventures on a Bear Hunt
Once upon a time, there were four brave adventurers - Tom, Jane, Timmy and April - who wanted to explore the great outdoors. So one day, they set out on an exciting bear hunt. 
They trudged through the long grass, waded through a river and splashed through a deep mud pool. Then suddenly, they saw some big bear paw prints! 
The four adventurers followed the paw prints until they came across a big cave. Cautiously, they peered inside the cave and spotted two bears cuddled up in a corner. 
Tom summoned all his courage and bravely stepped forward. But instead of being scared of him, the bears started to purr like cats! 
The four adventurers laughed with joy at the friendly bears. They petted them for a while before continuing their journey home. Everyone was so happy that they had gone on such an amazing bear hunt together!
