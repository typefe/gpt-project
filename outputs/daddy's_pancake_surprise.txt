Daddy's Pancake Surprise
Daddy woke up early on a Saturday morning and had a very special surprise for his family. He was going to make them pancakes for breakfast! He gathered all the ingredients he needed and started mixing them together. After adding a little bit of sugar, some cinnamon, and a few drops of vanilla extract, he cooked the pancakes over the stove. They smelled so delicious! 

When his children awoke they couldn't believe their eyes. Their father was making them pancakes! They all helped put butter, syrup, and fruit on the pancakes before sitting down to eat together as a family. Everyone agreed that Daddy's pancakes were the best in town, and they even asked for seconds! 

After they finished eating Daddy made sure to clean up all the dishes so Mommy wouldn't have any extra work to do. Everyone thanked Daddy for making them breakfast and went outside to enjoy a beautiful day in the sun. This would be a day they would always remember because of Daddy's yummy pancake surprise!
