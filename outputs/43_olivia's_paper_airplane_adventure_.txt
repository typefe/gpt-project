Olivia's Paper Airplane Adventure 
Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Olivia. She was very creative and loved to make things. One day, she decided to make a paper airplane. She carefully drew an outline of the plane on a piece of paper and then cut it out with scissors. After that, Olivia added some folds to the paper to give it shape and decorated it with markers and colors. 

Finally, the paper airplane was ready! Olivia ran outside and threw the plane into the sky. It began to soar higher and higher with each flap of its wings. Watching from below, Olivia smiled with joy as she saw her creation fly freely around her house. 

Olivia followed the plane around as it flew from tree to tree in her backyard. Every time it flew near her, she waved excitedly at it and wished it a safe journey. The plane kept going until eventually it disappeared behind some clouds in the distance. Olivia waved goodbye one last time before running back inside with a smile on her face, happy that she had been able to watch her own paper airplane soar through the air!
