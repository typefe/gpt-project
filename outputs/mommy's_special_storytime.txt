Mommy's Special Storytime
Mommy was sitting in a cozy chair, surrounded by her three little children. She opened up a good book and started to read. "Once upon a time," she began, "there lived a brave and kind princess..." The children leaned in close to listen, entranced by the story. Mommy's soft, gentle voice described all of the princess's adventures as they unfolded before them. Every night was special storytime with Mommy. The children felt so safe and happy knowing that their mommy would always be there, reading them stories until they drifted off to sleep.
