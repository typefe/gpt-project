Nick and His Clever Dog
Nick loved playing hide and seek with his beloved dog. He would often hide somewhere in the backyard, his dog the only one who knew where he was. One day, Nick hid behind a flower bush and waited for his dog to come find him. After some time, his dog finally caught up to him, and Nick was impressed at how clever his pup was! They continued to play for a while longer until nightfall when they both went inside to rest. Nick was so proud of the game they had played together!
