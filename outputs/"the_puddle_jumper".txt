"The Puddle Jumper"
Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lucy who loved to jump in puddles. Every time it rained, she would go outside with her rain boots and umbrella to find the biggest puddle she could find. She would take a deep breath and then leap right in! Splash! The cold water felt so refreshing on her skin. She would dance around and laugh as the water splashed around her. After a while, she would go back inside with her muddy clothes and show off her big smile. Lucy was the happiest when she was jumping in puddles. No matter what kind of day it was, it always made her feel better!
