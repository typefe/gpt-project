"Cuddles the Kitty"
Once upon a time there was a little kitty named Cuddles. She was the cutest, sweetest cat around. Everywhere she went, people couldn't help but smile at her fluffy fur and darling eyes. One day, Cuddles' family decided to take a walk in the nearby park. As they walked, Cuddles chased after butterflies and birds while her family laughed and watched in delight. 

Before long, it was time to head home. On their way back, Cuddles spotted a ball of yarn rolling across the sidewalk. Excitedly, she raced after it! Before long, she had caught up with it and was happily playing with the yarn when an elderly woman approached her family. She smiled warmly and said "what a cute little kitty you have there!" 

Cuddles' family nodded in agreement and thanked the woman for her kind words before continuing on their way home. From then on, whenever they went for walks in the park or around town, everyone would stop to comment on how cute Cuddles was - much to her delight! 

And that is why Cuddles will always be known as "the cutest kitty around."
