Chasing Squirrels
Once upon a time, there was a playful dog named Max who loved to explore and have adventures. On one of his outings, Max saw a fluffy gray squirrel scampering across the ground. Without hesitation, Max chased after it with wild enthusiasm! The squirrel was fast but Max kept running until the squirrel ran up a tall tree. Max stood by the trunk of the tree, barking and wagging his tail in delight. The squirrel watched from above as he barked and barked until finally both were too tired and fell asleep in the shade of the tree. From that day forward, whenever Max went outside he always had a lookout for more squirrels to chase!
