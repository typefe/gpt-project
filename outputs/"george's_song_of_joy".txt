"George's Song of Joy"
Once upon a time, there was a young boy named George who loved music. He enjoyed listening to others sing and play instruments, but he especially enjoyed singing and making up his own songs. One day, in his backyard, George put on a show for all of the animals and birds. He sang a song that he had made up himself about how wonderful it is to be alive and happy. The birds sang along as George's pure voice filled the air with joy. Everyone in the backyard that day felt the power of George's song and were warmed by its beauty. From then on, whenever George sang his song of joy, all of his friends felt better about life too.
