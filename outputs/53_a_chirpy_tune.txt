A Chirpy Tune
The birds were up early and singing their hearts out. It was such a beautiful song, and it danced through the morning air. All the little creatures of the forest had come out of their homes to listen to the sweet chirping tune. The squirrels and chipmunks stopped and listened, and the rabbits hopped in circles to the beat. Even the deer stopped in their tracks to take in the cheerful music. 

The birds couldn't help but feel proud that their melody had brought so much joy to all around them. They chirped louder and louder as they twirled in flight above the trees. Soon, even more animals had gathered around; all mesmerized by what they heard. 

The sun was barely above the horizon now and still, those birds kept on singing. Their tune seemed to be stuck in everyone's heads! Everyone hummed along as they said goodbye until they met next time under that same tree with a new chirpy tune from those wonderful birds!
