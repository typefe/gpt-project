The kids were so excited to be playing tag in the park. They had been waiting all week for this day. They started running around the grass, laughing and shouting as they tried to chase each other. The sun was shining brightly and there was a gentle breeze blowing through the trees. 

Their parents were sitting nearby, watching them with love and smiles on their faces. Everyone was enjoying themselves, even the birds in the sky who were singing along with the kids' laughter. 

The game went on for hours until finally, one of the kids was finally tagged and became "it". The others cheered and kept playing tag until it was almost time to go home. 

Finally, it was time to leave and everyone reluctantly made their way out of the park. But they were all happy knowing that they had a great time together in the park today!
