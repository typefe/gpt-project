Once upon a time, there was a little brown dog called Max who loved to play outside in the park. One day, as he was running around and enjoying his day out, he noticed a black and white cat sitting on top of a bench. Max had never seen such an elegant creature before and decided to give chase. The cat ran away, with Max hot on its tail. They ran around the park for what seemed like hours, with Max running faster than ever before! Eventually the cat got away and hid behind a tree, leaving Max exhausted but happy for the adventure. From that day forward, Max always looked forward to his trips to the park - just in case he saw that black and white cat again!
