'Let's Have a Picnic!'
Once upon a time, there were three friends, Sarah, Jonathan and Maria. They decided one day that they wanted to go on a picnic together. So they got together their snacks and drinks and headed off to the park. 

Once they arrived at the park, they found the perfect spot for their picnic. They spread out a big blanket and unpacked all their goodies – sandwiches, chips, donuts, juice boxes and some apples! 

The three friends had such a wonderful time eating their snacks and playing games. They laughed so much that soon it was time for them to pack up and go home. 

On the way back home Sarah said to her friends: "Let's do this again soon. It was so much fun!" Jonathan and Maria both agreed with her – it had been the best picnic ever!
