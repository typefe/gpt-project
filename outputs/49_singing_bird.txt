Singing Bird
Once upon a time, there was a small bird who could sing beautifully. One day, the bird had an idea to spread its sweet melody across the kingdom. So it flew up into the sky and began to sing. Every creature that heard the bird's song was filled with joy and delight. Even the grouchy old grumpybear stopped grumbling for a while to listen to the bird's singing. 

The bird sang its beautiful song until it had to take a break for rest. But even when it stopped, everyone kept humming along with its melody. Soon, people from all across the kingdom were singing along with the bird! Everyone was so happy that they decided to make this day special and called it "Singing Bird Day". 

From then on, every year they celebrated by having parades and dances with the singing bird leading them all! And everyone was so delighted that they continued humming and singing its sweet melody long after the day ended.
