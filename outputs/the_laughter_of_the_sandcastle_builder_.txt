The Laughter of the Sandcastle Builder 
Once upon a time, there was a young boy who had gone to the beach for an afternoon of fun and relaxation. He waded into the warm, shallow waters and began to make his way towards the shore. As he reached the sandy beach, he decided to build a sandcastle. He gathered up handfuls of wet, sticky sand and started to stack it one on top of the other. The boy laughed as he worked tirelessly on his sandcastle creation. His laughter echoed through the air as he carefully crafted a magnificent castle with towers and moats. After hours of work, it was finally done! The boy stood back and admired his creation with immense pride and joy before running off to explore other parts of the beach.
